# UC2-waveguiding
_Jakub Dokulil, updated 2. September 2021_

This is repository for waveguide fabrication. The project aims to create waveguides for total internal reflection microscopy as cheap as couple of Euros are. 

Introduction
------------

Total Internal Reflection (TIR) microscopy ... _blah blah blah -- this is not so important right?_

Printing the waveguides with FDM printer
----------------------------------------

![Extruding the waveguide](imgs/extruders_grey.png)

Goal was to pull the melted PETG from the hotend and create thread as thin as possible. The g-code you may find in the [FDM_waveguides](FDM_waveguides) folder.

The problem was, mainly with uneven and hardly controlable float of the filament. The created waveguides were later tested with weak signs of coupling. See following images

Spincoating approach
--------------------

The spincoating technique had been also chosen for the waveguide fabrication. 

__Loctite 3525__

The first photopolymer that had been tried, was loctite 3525.The recipe for the spincoating was adopted from [1] to create film as thin as possible. Therefore the recipe was following:

> 1. Rinse the coverslip with isopropanol, dry with preasured air.
> 2. Spin coat 5 s ramp 5 with 1 000 rpm, 30 s ramp 7 with 6 000 rpm.
> 3. Prebake on 60 째C for 2 min. This precedure helped to smoothen the surface as the surface hadn't been so nicely flat and smooth after spincoating.
> 4. Curing with knife cutted slits for 20 s full intensity.
> 5. Wash with acetone.

The created waveguides weren't good enough, so therefore the decision was met to use __MR DWL 5__.

__MR DWL 5__

The recipe for the second, more proffesional, photopolymer is following. The protocol have been created taking into account the producers documentation [2] (_needs to be found_).

> 1. Wash the coverslip (_Bene writes about the cleaning procedure_)
> 2. Spincoat for 30 s, ramp 7, 3 000 rpm
> 3. Prebake 90 째C for 4,5 min
> 4. 10 min wait
> 5. Cure with razorblade mask for 33 s (_now I'm not so sure about the time... sorry_). While curing move with the diffusive foil before the laser output.
> 6. Postbake on 90 째C for 4,5 min.
> 7. Wait 1 hour
> 8. Develop in Mr. DEV 5 for 90 s 
> 9. Hardbake for 20 min at 120 째C

The setup used for curing can be seen in the figure bellow. The intensity of beam passing throught the slit is 0,256 mW.
